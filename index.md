## About me ðŸ‘‹

<img align="left" width="215" height="300" style="padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="/assets/mattpic.jpg">

I'm a managing senior research engineer at
[Educational Testing Service](https://ets.org) AI Labs. Since 2011 I have
worked at ETS as a part of many teams, including NLP architecture, content
assessment/feedback, etc. I have also recently taught a course on lingustic
annotation at Montclair State University. My research interests include
natural language and speech processing and machine learning, especially in
relation to applications to automated scoring technology. My interests include
Python, AWS, machine learning with `scikit-learn`, `transformers`, `allennlp`,
etc., MLOps, NLP, Java, Bash, Rust, etc.

I obtained a master's degree in Applied Linguistics (with a certificate in
Computational Linguistics) from Montclair State University in 2016 and a
bachelor's degree (double major in English and Linguistics) from University of
Pennsylvania in 2008.

Aside from publishing in NLP/speech conferences (listed below), I also have
served as a reviewer for NLP conferences such as ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, and COLING.
