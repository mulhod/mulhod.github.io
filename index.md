## About me ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Research Enginner at [Educational Testing Service](ets.org). I have worked at ETS in the NLP/Speech group doing automated scoring since 2011, first as a senior research assistant, then as an assistant research engineer and associated research engineer, and now as a research engineer since mid-2018.
My research interests include natural language and speech processing and machine learning, especially in relation to applications to automated scoring technology.
Programming interests: Python, Rust, Java, NLP and machine learning with `spaCy`, `scikit-learn`, `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow`, etc., grid engine and GPU usage, etc.

I obtained a master's degree in Applied Linguistics (with a certificate in Computational Linguistics) from Montclair State University in 2016 and a bachelor's degree (major in English and Linguistics) from University of Pennsylvania in 2008.
