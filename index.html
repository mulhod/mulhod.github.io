<div id="bio-content">
<p>I have worked at Educational Testing Service in the automated scoring and natural language processing group since 2011, first as a senior research assistant and now as an assistant research engineer since 2014. Currently, I am completing an MS program in applied linguistics and a certificate in computational linguistics at Montclair State University. My interests include various sub-fields of natural language processing, especially in relation to applications to automated scoring technology, and computer science, especially Python programming.</p>

<p>Some stuff about research</p>
</div>

<div id="personal-content">
<h1>Music</h1>
<p>I am a fan of various types of music, including rock, blues, and folk, but especially music that involves slide guitar. One of my most distinguishing characteristics is that I follow -- perhaps to an unhealthy degree -- three main artists and I listen to these three almost exclusively: Bob Dylan, George Harrison, and Elliott Smith. I believe that Bob Dylan, as a lyricist, is unparalleled. In fact, I would go so far as to say that he belongs among the greatest English writers of all time, including writers like Shakespeare and Vladimir Nabakov. George Harrison, on the other hand, I like mainly due to his other-wordly slide guitar compositions. It speaks volumes to me that, though he was not often now held in high regard by his bandmates and was only allowed a song or two on any given Beatles record, he was still able to produce some of the most memorable Beatles songs, including "Something", "Here Comes the Sun", and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", all of which do not even contain slide guitar parts. Last but certainly not least, Elliott Smith rounds out my top three. He practically falls between Dylan and Harrison, musically speaking, with his exquisite melodies and strangely penetrating lyrics. It is to me a blessing that there are so many collaborations between the first two and so many covers of Dylan and Harrison songs by Smith. It feels as though the connection between the trio that I clearly see is validated. However, while Harrison and Smith frequently trade spots in my ranking of the three, Bob Dylan holds the number one spot by a long shot.</p>
<h1>TV</h1>
<p>I enjoy many television shows and am always on the lookout for the next great one. However, not unlike my tastes in music, I consider three series to be greatest of all time: Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, and The Wire. Another parallel to my top musical trio is that one of these shows is, I believe, far and away the greatest and that is Breaking Bad. Never before or since have I witnessed such expert storytelling, cinematography, and character development. Breaking Bad revolutionized television as we know it. This series is practically a study in character development: milquetoast father and high school teacher evolves into ruthless drug kingpin. In the beginning it is hard not to be on the side of Walter White. But, by the end, it is hardly even a question as to whether his actions can be justified: he becomes the embodiment of evil. Coming in second and third, frequently trading places in my mind, are The Wire and The Sopranos. It mostly depends of which one I have been watching most recently.</p>
<p>There are certainly other shows that I consider to be great, even if not in the same league as the three series mentioned above. These include Deadwood, Mad Men, Dexter, The Shield, earlier seasons of The Walking Dead, the first fantastic season of the new series True Detective, Battlestar Gallactica, and many others.</p>
<h1>Sports</h1>
<p>I enjoy watching all major sports, but NHL hockey is the one that I follow most closely. I also follow NFL and college football and MLB baseball and I am an occasional basketball fan. Since I grew up in and around Philadelphia, my favorite teams are all of the Philadelphia teams. You don't get to choose your teams just like you don't get to choose your parents. There is no choice. In my mind, the only situation where you do get to choose a team is with foreign sports leagues. I will allow some front-running fan to choose whatever soccer team is dominating Europe. Other than that, you can't choose a team just because your dad liked it or just because they were winning for a couple years when you were seven years old. I will allow that certain non-local teams can have a special place in your heart, but only as second -- and far distant -- teams.</p>
<h2>Hockey</h2>
<p>The only sport that I actually play -- and have played since I was a little kid -- is hockey. People don't often think of Philadelphia as a hockey town, but all I know is that, as a youth, this is the sport we played in the streets in Philadelphia. There was even a public ice hockey rink a few blocks from my house. Hockey holds a special place in the heart of many Philadelphians. Transplanted to Ewing, NJ, I have found that there is also a large group of people who play hockey on a regular basis. If anybody would like to join, we usually get together for pick-up games on the weekends.
